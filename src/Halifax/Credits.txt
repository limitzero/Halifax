Halifax :  A local implementation of developing domain models with command query separation

The idea for this simple implementation came from the following sources with a little adaptation:

Mark Nihojf  - Fohjin Project ( https://github.com/MarkNijhof/Fohjin, blog: http://cre8ivethought.com/blog/index)
Ncqrs Framework - The CQRS Framework for .NET — http://ncqrs.org (defunct, now on github.com)
Bifrost  - https://github.com/dolittle/Bifrost

Greg Young

**Uses Castle Windsor for IoC internally for component resolving

Features:
- Command and Query Separation via defined interfaces on messages
- Small bus structure to push messages (async and sync versions of event bus)
- Central context object for working with layered implementations for processing the command objects to remote facade
- NHibernate used event and persistant view storage (can implement your own by deriving from interfaces IEventStorage and IReadModelRepository<>)

Still rough but does a lot, enjoy :)
